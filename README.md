# Image Classification Model Development Notebook

In this notebook you will find a very detailed exercise on the development of image classification algorithms using Neural Networks. I made myself sure to include the best practices relating the process of developing high accuracy classification algorithms. Everything is covered, from reviewing the data to deploying best practices. I hope you enjoy and learn lots, just as i did.

The goal of this project is to recognice hand gestures from the Alphabet in international sign language. This jupyter notebooks was inspired by the loyal work of my friend Janina, who's work life is focused on helping deaf people to live in a more inclusive society. 

Janina, if you ever read this, the world needs more people like you! â™¥
